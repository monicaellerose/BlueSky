The provided Tampermonkey script is designed to run in a web browser and perform a specific action when a user enters a particular pattern in the address bar. Here's a summary of what the script does:

    Trigger Condition:
        The script listens for the event of the web page content being loaded (DOMContentLoaded).

    Pattern Detection:
        It checks if the current URL contains the specified delimiter, which is "xbluesky" in this case.

    Redirection:
        If the delimiter is found in the URL, the script extracts the text that follows the delimiter.
        It then constructs a new URL by appending the extracted text as a query parameter to https://bsky.app/search?q=.
        Finally, it redirects the browser to the newly constructed URL.
